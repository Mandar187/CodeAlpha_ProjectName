Joined CodeAlpha as a C++ Intern to sharpen my backend logic and dive deep into the fundamentals that power every great game. Worked on real-world problem-solving, wrote clean and efficient C++ code, and gained valuable experience in structured programming, object-oriented design, and algorithmic thinking.

This internship strengthened my coding muscles, taught me how to think like a system architect, and gave me a deeper appreciation for the power behind every line of logic.
